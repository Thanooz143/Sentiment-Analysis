# Sentiment Analysis Project
Overview
The Sentiment Analysis project aims to predict the sentiment of a given text, classifying it into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral. This task is commonly used for analyzing customer reviews, social media posts, and other types of textual data to gain insights into public opinion or customer satisfaction.

The project leverages various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to convert raw text into numerical data and train a model to predict sentiment. The primary goal of this project is to build a robust and efficient sentiment classifier that can generalize well to unseen data.

# Key Features
### 1)Text Preprocessing: The project includes comprehensive text cleaning steps such as tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming/lemmatization to prepare the text for model training.
Feature Extraction: Utilizes techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and n-grams (unigrams and bigrams) to convert raw text into numerical feature vectors.
### 2)Model Training: Various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Naive Bayes, are applied for sentiment classification.
### 3)Evaluation: The model performance is evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix.
### 4)Handling Class Imbalance: Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) are applied to address class imbalances in the dataset and improve model performance.
